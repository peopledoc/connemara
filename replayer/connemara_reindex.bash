### Create missing index on FK ###

# then to array_upper(conkey,1) because our index must START exactly the same as the conkey
# the slice on indkey is offset by -1 because indkey is a int2vector, those start at 0
# As the key order is of no importance, the arrays just need to be included in each other
# (equals in the ensemblist sense)
